<h>">What is Prayer Ministry?</h>


<p>Prayer Ministry on a Sunday is available for those who have prayer needs for themselves or someone they know or love.  Members of the Prayer Ministry team have been trained to undertake this ministry.  Members of the team pray in groups of two with one member leading and another member present for support.  The Prayer Ministry team do not offer counselling or advice but rather the Prayer Ministry team members will pray and seek God's divine input for the situation(s) or person(s) prayed for.</br>
      
Prayer Ministry is a ministry that respects strict confidentiality and also the integrity of the individual.  The Church encourages people to partake of this and make it an effective and important part of our Church witness.  The team will delight in praying with them and hope more people will take up this opportunity.        </br>

The team promotes Jesus to be the centre of this ministry and our team encourages individuals to remain after church for ministry.  After the service the person(s) need only remain in their seat and the team members will join them or if anyone would like to make an appointment for Prayer Ministry, a request slip should be completed (available from the welcome desk) and placed it in the Prayer Request Box at the back of the Church foyer or e-mail <a href="mailto:westprayer@hotmail.co.uk?subject=West Church Prayer Page">Prayer Team</a>. A story which illustrates the concept of prayer ministry is available <a href="Prayer/Two Horses.pdf">here</a>.
        
        
<h2>Prayer, Bible Study, and Fellowship</h2>

 These are foundational in the life of West Church and therefore we seek to provide opportunities to share in prayer, learning and fellowship. During July and August, we would ask that you pray for our Ministerial Team.  Points for prayer are available <a href="Bulletins/31 days Praying for our Ministry Team, Youth, Elders.pdf">here</a>. The Prayer Vision which we have for West Church can be viewed <a href="Prayer/Prayer Vision.pdf">here</a>.
  <h2>Time for Prayer</h2>

      Takes the form of an informal group which gathers on Sunday at 10:30 am and 6:00 pm in the Prayer Room for prayer before morning and evening worship.
      
 <h2>Session Prayer Time</h2>
The members of Kirk Session meet together for prayer on the third Sunday of each month at 9.45 am, facilitated by the Ministry Team.
<h2">Prayer Bulletin</h2>
This is published monthly and is available from the Welcome Desk. This gives a focus for individual prayer and topics to pray for during the incoming week.
     
     Our goal is to see this space   being used to its full potential and the congregation taking time to visit and spend time in His presence using the resources available.
     <h2>Prayer Wheels<h2>
For special occasions or as needs arise, a Prayer Wheel is organised to provide 48 hours of continuous prayer coverage. Participants commit themselves to praying during one or more of the 30 minute prayer slots during the 48 hour period. Several people can pray during the same time slot. </p>
